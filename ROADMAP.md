# rsahp Roadmap

Deferred / planned work items, with enough design detail to resume cleanly.

## Deferred: Developers Cockpit enrichment + PowerShell launcher

**Status:** DEFERRED (2026-07-14) — **blocked on the product-packaging work** (see below). Design is complete and approved; implementation is shelved, not cancelled.

**Why deferred (sequencing decision):** The cockpit's *SHIP & RELEASE* tier orchestrates the release/packaging machinery. The upcoming **product packaging** work (Windows Inno Setup installer + Linux Flatpak) will define the real release artifacts, their paths, and whether builds run locally or in CI. Building the cockpit's release tier before those facts exist guarantees rework. The dev-loop/quality/housekeeping tiers are packaging-independent, but splitting the cockpit into two implementation phases fragments a cohesive tool and forces a costly context reload — so the whole cockpit waits. (AGY-FIRST + user-approved: architecture fork → "dual-mode façade", refined by user to "enrich xtask + thin launcher"; sequencing fork → defer entire cockpit, do packaging first.)

**Resume condition:** After product packaging (inno/flatpak) ships and the release mechanics are settled. Then pull this off the shelf, reconcile the SHIP & RELEASE tier against the real packaging outputs, and implement in one sweep.

### Approved design

**Shape:** ONE cockpit (the existing `cargo xtask`, enriched) + a thin `scripts/DevelopersCockpit.ps1` launcher. Single source of truth in Rust (`xtask/src/main.rs`); PowerShell is just the front door. No duplicated logic.

**Model reference:** `C:\Users\user\Development\Node\corelib\DevelopersCockpit.py` (letter-keyed, 4-tier ANSI menu; `Action(key, group, desc, cmd|handler, note)` model; colored banner with version/config; handlers for health-check, release packaging, lockstep version bump).

**`xtask` reorganized into 4 tiers** (menu keys: letters grouped by tier, per the model — number keys are acceptable too). ● = already implemented in xtask this session; ＋ = new work:

| Tier | Actions |
|---|---|
| **INNER LOOP** | ● Quick (build & launch) · ● Format & Lint · ＋ Build workspace (`cargo build --workspace`) |
| **QUALITY GATE** | ● Unit tests (`cargo nextest run`) · ● Coverage (`cargo llvm-cov nextest`) · ● Supply-chain & hygiene (`cargo deny check` + `cargo machete` + `typos`) · ＋ Contract test (`.\verify.ps1`) |
| **SHIP & RELEASE** *(depends on packaging)* | ● Fullscale (commit & push) · ● Version bump (lockstep) · ＋ Tag & push (`v<ver>`) · ＋ Local release package (zip of `target/release`) — **reconcile against inno/flatpak outputs at resume time** |
| **HOUSEKEEPING** | ＋ Health check (tool versions: cargo/rustc/nextest/llvm-cov/deny/machete/typos/gh/lefthook/sea-orm-cli) · ＋ Clean (`cargo clean`) · ● Quit |

**New xtask functionality to add:** build-workspace, contract-test (invoke `verify.ps1`), tag & push, local release-zip, health-check, clean. Reuse the existing `binary_present()` PATH probe and `version_bump()` handler. Keep the menu-alive-on-error pattern (`.run().ok()` / `if let Err`). Missing tools degrade to a note, not a crash.

**`scripts/DevelopersCockpit.ps1` (thin launcher):** (a) `cd` to repo root (works from anywhere / double-click); (b) check `cargo` is on PATH (friendly message if absent); (c) run `cargo xtask`, passing any args straight through so `.\scripts\DevelopersCockpit.ps1 quick` also works as a non-interactive shortcut. No menu logic of its own.

**Testing:** unit-test the new pure-logic helpers in xtask (release-artifact path list, version→tag string) via `cargo nextest run -p xtask`; launcher gets a manual smoke + arg-passthrough check. Menu interaction stays manual (YAGNI for an internal tool).

## In progress: Product packaging (Inno Setup + Flatpak)

Windows Inno Setup installer + Linux Flatpak for the egui/axum app, via a single-binary `rsahp-desktop` wrapper. **Design + line-level plan complete and panel-hardened** (3 adversarial-panel rounds folded): spec at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-14-desktop-packaging-design.md`, plan at `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-14-desktop-packaging.md`. Ready for subagent-driven execution (P1 data-dir → P2 wrapper → P3 Inno → P4 Flatpak). This is the blocker for the cockpit's SHIP & RELEASE tier above.

## Deferred: loopback backend auth hardening (security follow-up)

**Status:** DEFERRED (2026-07-14) — surfaced by the packaging plan's adversarial panel (finding R3-1), user-decided to defer. **Pre-existing** — present in the current dev app, NOT introduced by packaging.

**Issue:** The backend's JWT auth uses a hardcoded static signing secret (`backend/src/api_auth.rs:20` — `const JWT_SECRET = b"super-secret-key-change-in-production"`). It is compiled into every binary and identical across installs, so any local process (or a browser blind-POSTing to `127.0.0.1`) can forge a valid token and bypass the auth on `/api/documents` etc. The routes ARE JWT-gated, but the gate is forgeable.

**Options for the follow-up spec:** (a) generate a per-install random secret at first run (store in the data-dir config, never in source); (b) have the `rsahp-desktop` wrapper mint a one-time in-memory token per launch and hand it to both the embedded backend (to validate) and the frontend (as `Authorization: Bearer`); (c) also consider CSRF/origin checks for the localhost server. Note the Flatpak packaging already mitigates the *cross-process* vector on Linux by dropping `--share=network` (R3-2), so the backend is not reachable outside the sandbox there; Windows has no such containment, so it remains exposed until this lands.

**Also noted:** the dev login seed (`admin`/…) is `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]`, so a RELEASE/packaged build has no seeded user — confirm the packaged onboarding/registration path when this is picked up.

## Deferred: desktop-packaging code-review follow-ups (non-blocking)

Surfaced by the final `rust-reviewer` pass on the `desktop-packaging` branch (2026-07-14). None block the packaging merge; the branch passes the real CI gate (`cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, fmt, tests) cleanly. Tracked here for later.

- **#3 — UNC path yields a malformed sqlite URL.** `common/src/datadir.rs` `database_url_from_path`: a Windows UNC data-dir (`\\server\share\...`, possible under enterprise profile redirection) becomes `//server/share/...` after backslash→slash, so the leading-slash guard does nothing and the URL ends up `sqlite:////server/share/...` (four slashes), likely misparsed as an authority. Not exercised by current tests (drive-letter + POSIX only). Add a UNC guard + a unit test. Narrow/enterprise-only.
- **#4 — `cargo pkgid` version parse is toolchain-format-fragile.** `xtask/src/main.rs` `build_windows_installer`: correct on cargo ≥1.77 (`…#name@version`), but on older cargo emitting the legacy `#name:version` form the `#`-fallback would capture `"rsahp-desktop:0.1.0"` as the version, breaking the Inno `/DMyAppVersion=` define. No `rust-toolchain.toml` pins a minimum. Either pin a min toolchain or split on `:` in the fallback. Currently inert.
- **#5 — `AppConfig::save()` silently drops write errors.** `frontend/src/config.rs`: `let _ = fs::write(...)`. Correctly non-panicking (as designed), but a preference change (`use_gpu`, `zoom_scale`) that fails to persist to a read-only dir gives the user no feedback. Pre-existing pattern (only the target path changed this branch). Consider surfacing a non-fatal warning.
